[ngrok](https://ngrok.com)

> Note: To avoid having the ngrok name changed all the time use from within a Teams project in two seperate terminals, or even better run gulp start-ngrok in a seperate standalone console window.

Replace `gulp ngrok-serve` from within a Teams proj with:

```
gulp start-ngrok
```

```
gulp serve --debug
```
